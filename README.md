## Installation

To install Workflow Manager, use Composer:

```
composer require ahmedebead/workflow-manager
```

## Configuration

Publish the configuration file with the following Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config
```

This will create a `config/workflow.php` file where you can define your workflows, conditions, and actions.

## Commands

### Create Workflow

Generates a new workflow and updates the configuration file and Create the necessary folders for the workflow classes in app/Workflows.


**Usage:**

```bash
php artisan workflow:create
```

**Example:**

```
Enter the workflow name: OrderWorkflow
Enter the model class for this workflow (e.g., \App\Models\User): \App\Models\Order
Workflow 'OrderWorkflow' created successfully.
```

### Create Condition

Creates a new condition class for a workflow.

**Usage:**

```bash
php artisan workflow:condition
```

**Example:**

```
Enter the workflow name: OrderWorkflow
Enter the condition name: IsPending
Condition 'IsPending' created successfully.
```
***Example condition:***
```php
<?php

namespace App\Workflows\Users\Conditions;

use AhmedEbead\WorkflowManager\Contracts\ConditionInterface;

class UserActivatedCondition implements ConditionInterface
{
    public function check($model)
    {
        // Your Condition logic here
        // return $model->status == 'active';
    }
}
```

### Create Action

Creates a new action class associated with a condition. You can choose to make the action queueable or not.

**Usage:**

```bash
php artisan workflow:action
```

**Example:**

```
Enter the workflow name: OrderWorkflow
Enter the condition name this action is associated with: IsPending
Enter the action name: SendEmail
Should this action be queueable? (yes/no): yes
Action 'SendEmail' created successfully with queueable support.
```
***Example queueable action:***
```php
<?php

namespace App\Workflows\Order\Actions;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Throwable;

class ReserveStockAction implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;

    protected $model;

    public function __construct($model)
    {
        $this->model = $model;
    }

    public function handle()
    {
        try {
            Log::info("Executing ReserveStockAction for model: " . get_class($this->model));
            // Your action logic here
        } catch (Throwable $e) {
            Log::error('ReserveStockAction failed.', ['exception' => $e, 'model' => get_class($this->model)]);

            if ($this->attempts() < config('workflow.retry.attempts')) {
                $this->release(config('workflow.retry.delay'));
            } else {
                $this->fail($e);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

***Example normal action:***
```php
<?php

namespace App\Workflows\Users\Actions;

use AhmedEbead\WorkflowManager\Contracts\ActionInterface;

class ReserveStockAction implements ActionInterface
{
    public function execute($model)
    {
        // Your action logic here
    }
}
```

### Export Workflow

Export a workflow and its conditions/actions as a flowchart:

```bash
php artisan workflow:export
```

**Prompts:**

*   Enter the workflow name.

**Details:**

1.  **Generate DOT File**  
    The command generates a DOT file representing the workflow's conditions and actions. The DOT file is created at `app/Workflows/{workflowName}/{workflowName}.dot`.
2.  **Convert DOT to PNG (Optional)**  
    If Graphviz is installed on your system, the DOT file is converted to a PNG image for easier visualization. The PNG file is saved in the same directory as the DOT file.

**Important:** To convert the DOT file to a PNG image, you must have Graphviz installed. If Graphviz is not installed or the conversion fails, you'll see a warning message.

#### Installing Graphviz

*   **Ubuntu/Debian:**
