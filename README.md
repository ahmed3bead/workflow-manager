## Introduction

Workflow Manager facilitates the creation and management of workflows in Laravel applications. It integrates with your Eloquent models and provides a flexible system for defining conditions and actions.

## Installation

To install Workflow Manager, use Composer:

```
composer require ahmedebead/workflow-manager
```

## Configuration

Publish the configuration file with the following Artisan command:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config
```

This will create a `config/workflow.php` file where you can define your workflows, conditions, and actions.

## Commands

Workflow 'OrderWorkflow' created successfully.
```

### Create Condition

Creates a new condition class for a workflow.

**Usage:**

```
php artisan workflow:condition
```

**Example:**

```
Enter the workflow name: OrderWorkflow
Enter the condition name: IsPending

```

### Create Action

Creates a new action class associated with a condition.

**Usage:**

```

Enter the condition name this action is associated with: IsPending
Enter the action name: SendEmail
Action 'SendEmail' created successfully.
```
